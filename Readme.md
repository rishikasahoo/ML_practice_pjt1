# General instructions:

1. This module contains two notebooks 'NB1.ipynb' and 'NB2.ipynb'. Solve them in this order.
2. To run the notebooks you should select the _kernel_ at top right corner of VSCode as shown below ![kernel](../assets/kernelSelect.png)
   Now select `Python Environments..`, this should show your _pyDS_ environment (created in module **0-Setup**) which you need to select . If _pyDS_ doesnot showup, you need to provide the path to it which should look like
   ```
   path_to_anaconda3\envs\pyDS\python.exe
   ```
   where `path_to_anaconda3` is the folder path where _anaconda3_ is installed. If you still face problems, contact me.
3. For each notebook, go through the individual code cells carefully and run them to convince yourself that they give the correct results.
4. Pay attention to the comments as they contain useful information and also show how you should structure your code.
5. Put you answers in code cells with comment "your code here". For additional text explanations you could add a markdown cell below it.
